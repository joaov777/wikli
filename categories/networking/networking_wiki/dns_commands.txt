# Some DNS commands

- Recursive DNS 
	- DNS server used for resolving other people's domains. A good example would be 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1

- Authoritative DNS
	- Provides actual answer to dns queries.
	- It contains the zones for its domain.
	- It can't answer queries that are not referencing its entries.
	- It only replies to its own registers.
